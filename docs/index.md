# ABACUS Pseudopot-Nao Square  
## About  
**ABACUS** (Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at UStc) **Pseudopot** (pseudopotential)-**Nao** (numerical atomic orbital) **Square** (**APNS**) is a project for continuously generating pseudopotential and numerical atomic orbital test data for ABACUS user. The project is based on the [ABACUS](https://github.com/deepmodeling/abacus-develop) project, which is a high-performance ab initio simulation software for electronic structure calculation.  

## Author information  
**APNS** is mainly developed and maintained by the ABACUS-AISI (Artificial Intelligence for Science Institute, BEIJING) team.
