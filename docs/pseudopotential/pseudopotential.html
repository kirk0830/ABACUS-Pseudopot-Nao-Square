Pseudopotentials are developed to model the interactions between core electrons and valence electrons. Today, in addition to the traditional norm-conserving formalism, numerous other types have been well-developed, including ultrasoft and PAW pseudopotentials. However, due to the non-uniqueness in pseudopotential parameterization, a variety of pseudopotential sets are generated for different specific purposes, even within the same framework.

At APNS, we currently test only norm-conserving pseudopotentials, though ABACUS has recently begun to support ultrasoft pseudopotentials in plane-wave calculations. For additional testing of ultrasoft pseudopotentials, please consult the Standard Solid State Pseudopotential (SSSP) library (<a href="https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/sssp/table/precision">link</a>), where Quantum ESPRESSO is employed for testing.
