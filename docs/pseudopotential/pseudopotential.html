Pseudopotentials are constructed for describing interaction between core/core-electrons and valence electrons.
 However, due to the non-uniqueness of pseudopotential parameterization, for one construction of pseudopotential,
 for example the norm-conserving pseudopotential, there are many different sets of pseudopotentials generated
 based on slightly different purposes. <br>
For all atoms, only norm-conserving pseudopotentials are tested, although ultrasoft pseudopotentials are recently
 supported by ABACUS planewave calculation. For more tests on ultrasoft pseudopotentials, please refer to the
