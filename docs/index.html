<h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p class="plain-text">Welcome to ABACUS-Pseudopotential-Numerical atomic orbital Square (APNS). APNS aims to provide pseudopotentials and numerical atomic orbitals with high efficiency and precision for ABACUS user simulating. APNS is mainly developed and maintained by ABACUS-AISI team.</p>

<h1>Pseudopotential test</h1>
    <p class="plain-text">This section provides pseudopotential test for <code>basis_type lcao</code> calculation. In this test suites, not only norm-conserving but also ultrasoft pseudopotentials are tested for each element as long as availble. For <code>basis_type pw</code> calculation referring pseudopotential and plane wave combinations, please refer to Pseudopot-Pw test section instead.
    In this section <code>ecutwfc</code> is tested for cohesive energies, pressure and zon-boundary phonon frequencies, converged <code>ecutwfc</code> is provided for user.</p>
