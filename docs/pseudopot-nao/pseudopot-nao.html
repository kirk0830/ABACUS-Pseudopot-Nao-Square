What is important for accurancy test on numerical atomic orbitals? <br>
For numerical atomic orbital used in ABACUS, its construction idea originates from local expansion
of planewaves. The space spanned by numerical atomic orbitals is a subspace of the one spanned by planewaves.
Therefore, numerical atomic orbitals should reproduce information of planewaves as much as possible.<br>
Moreover, the wavefunction from planewave calculation relies on the pseudopotential, which indicates
 the dependence of numerical atomic orbitals on specific pseudopotential and thus pseudopotentials and
 numerical atomic orbitals are always tested together in this page. <br>
For more information about ABACUS numerical atomic orbitals, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4241">
Systematically improvable optimized atomic basis sets for ab. initio. calculations</a>.<br>
