"""version 1 driver is more well-designed, it seperate the whole workflow in a different way from version 0

version 1 considers more about "ITERATE" rather than "FLOW" in version 0.
Therefore version 1 will first do Cartesian direct product on calculation_settings and pseudopotential-
numerical atomic orbital settings. The first iteration layer is caculation_settings, the second iteration-
layer is pseudopotential-numerical atomic orbital settings. The third iteration layer is systems.

Therefore
