This workflow collection is for performing tests on pseudopotential (pseudopot) and pseudopot-nao (numerical atomic orbital) bundle. It also provides interface with ABACUS numerical atomic orbital generation code, called SIAB, presently is also maintained by
AISI-ABACUS developers.

If it is the first run of APNS, please make sure your environment configured correctly:
1. store pseudopotentials in directory and specified in input file the `pseudo_dir`, similarly for numerical atomic ortbials, set `orbital_dir`. The APNS workflow will check and update the file `pseudo_db.json` everytime when starts. 

2. Also in `pseudo_dir`, please have a file `rules.json` in it. In this file, user should explicitly define three domains to identify one kind of pseudopotential. Apart from three domains needed to define for each pseudopotential, another two keys are needed 
to defined: re.folder and re.file. With these two keys, one can always get pseudopotentials identified from mixture of pseudopotentials.

For more information about setting of input_*.json for different tasks, please refer to online documentation.
