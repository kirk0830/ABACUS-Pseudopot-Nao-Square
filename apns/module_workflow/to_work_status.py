           use `theoretical=False` tag, to filter out all not experimentally-observed structures. Not use `is_stable` tag because
           it filters out too many commonly seen structures. The `is_stable` does not mean filtering out unstable structures,
           but is filter out all not "destination structures". e.g., Anatase TiO2 will transform to Rutile TiO2 at high 
           temperature, but if `is_stable` is `True`, then Anatase will be filtered out.
