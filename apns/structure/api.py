    """# API of online crystal structure database
    General interface to download structures from different databases.
    
    ### Usage
    a complete form of function call would be:
    ```python
    from apns.module_structure.api import download
    log = download(formula, n_structures, api_key, database, stru_cache_dir)
    ```
    The `formula` is a dict and should be like:
    ```python
    formula = {"mp": ["Er2O3", "TiO2"],
               "cod": ["V2O5", "Bk"],
               "optimade": ["Ti4O9", "TiO2"]}
    ```
    The `n_structures` is also a dict and should be like:
    ```python
    n_structures = {"mp": [1, 2], "cod": [1, 1], "optimade": [1, 1]}
    ```
    , which means download 1 structure for "Er2O3" and 2 structures for "TiO2" from Materials Project,
    1 structure for "V2O5" and 1 structure for "Bk" from Crystallography Open Database, and 1 structure
    for "Ti4O9" and 1 structure for "TiO2" from OPTIMADE API.
    or the simplest form:
    ```python
    from apns.module_structure.api import download
    log = download(formula, n_structures)
    ```
    Function will return a dict whose keys are formula and values are tuple, the first
    is the file path of downloaded structure, the second is the magnetism information.
    ### Database documentation
    - mp: Materials Project
    - mv: Materials Virtual Lab
    - cod: Crystallography Open Database
    - optimade: OPTIMADE API
    ### Online database credentials
    See their official website for more information. For example the Materials Project, you should
    have an API key to download structures.
