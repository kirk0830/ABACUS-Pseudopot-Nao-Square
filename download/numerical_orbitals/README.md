# ABACUS Pseudopot-Nao Square  
## In brief  
This folder stores downloaded and generated numerical atomic orbitals.  
## Nomenclature  
First follows nomenclature of pseudopotential, folders with identical names with pseudopotentials always corresponds.  
In pseudopotential-defined folder, numerical atomic orbitals are stored in subfolders named in the following way:  
```text
<atomic number>_<element symbol>_<zeta>  
```
where:  
- `<atomic number>` is the atomic number of the element, like `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.  
- `<element symbol>` is the element symbol of the element, like `H`, `He`, `Li`, etc.  
- `<zeta>` is the zeta of the numerical atomic orbitals, like `SZ`, `DZP`, `TZDP`, etc.
