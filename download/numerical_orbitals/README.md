# ABACUS Pseudopot-Nao Square  
## In brief  
This folder stores downloaded and generated numerical atomic orbitals.  
## Nomenclature  
First follows nomenclature of pseudopotential, folders with identical names with pseudopotentials always corresponds.  
In pseudopotential-defined folder, numerical atomic orbitals are stored in subfolders named in the following way:  
```text
<atomic number>_<element symbol>_<zeta>  
```
where:  
- `<atomic number>` is the atomic number of the element, like `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.  
- `<element symbol>` is the element symbol of the element, like `H`, `He`, `Li`, etc.  
- `<zeta>` is the zeta of the numerical atomic orbitals, like `SZ`, `DZP`, `TZDP`, etc. 
## File management
Orbital files are managed in following philosophy:
1. once the pseudopotential is uniquely defined, the minimal basis is also uniquely defined. Thus DZP, TZDP, ... zeta notation expression will not cause ambiguity. Combine the zeta notation with the minimal basis get by parsing pseudopotential of element, the detailed orbital configuration like `2s2p2d1f` can be inferred. Thus under the folder named as identifier of pseudopotential, there are folders named as: `[rcut]au_[ecutwfc]Ry_[zeta notation](_[appendix])`, for instance, `6au_60Ry_SZ`, `6au_60Ry_DZP`, `6au_60Ry_TZDP`, `6au_60Ry_TZDP_1`, `6au_60Ry_TZDP_2`, etc.
## Generation
Numerical atomic orbitals are generated by the following steps:
0. Download and configure `PTG_dpsi` code from [ABACUS-orbital](https://github.com/abacusmodeling/ABACUS-orbitals), following the instructions in the README.md file or tutorial [Gitbook: Generate numerical atomic orbital with high precision](https://mcresearch.github.io/abacus-user-guide/abacus-nac3.html)
1. Dimer structure generation
2. SCF calculation to scan `ecutwfc`
3. Bond length scan with fixed `ecutwfc`
4. Orbital configuration and `SIAB_INPUT` generation
